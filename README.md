## About me
### Hi there 👋🏽 I'm Jared,
I'm a solo game developer that goes by the name **Active || Activist**⚡.  
I enjoy creating games and creating libraries/modules that will help others create games.  
I develop in the 2D Game engine [Vylocity](https://www.vylocity.com/).  

As well as being a programmer I'm learning to compose music, and create pixel art in my spare time😀.  

You can check out some of the things I've:

~~🎨 drawn: [coming soon 🚧🚧]()~~  
<!--💻 developed: [here](https://www.vylocity.com/user/Activist/creations)-->
